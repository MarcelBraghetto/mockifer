After building there will be a ‘Mockifer.framework’ package here.

Add it to your iOS project to use Mockifer and point your iOS app to http://localhost:8502 to connect.

You will also need to include the ‘mockifer-js’ content folder in your iOS solution.

Open the Products/sample-ios/ project for an example of how to integrate the framework.
